An example of a perfectly looping GIF made via p5js!

**Features**

WAVES

- I used math to plot a sine wave and then update the points over time

BREAKFAST

- I put together a bunch of shapes (well, only a few if you don't count all the individual eggs) to make breakfast. Used random for the first time (I think)

SPOTS

- I kinda wanted to make a mini rave so I could feel like I go out on weekends, but what I ended up with was bright flashy poka dots with a dark looney tunes title card

**Acknowledgements**

Shoutout to p5js.org for being the w3schools of p5! I learned a lot about random functions that I'd like to learn more about as the quarter progresses (especially lerp, which looks super cool, but I could not get to work for the life of me (https://p5js.org/examples/motion-morph.html))).

Special shoutout to Professor Compton as well, as much of this code was based loosely off of what she provided us.


As always, shoutout to google fonts for free stuff!
