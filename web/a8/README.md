**Overview**

Using a large source of data, create a new app to browse and visualize that data. The user should be able to interact with the data in some way.

**Features**

The data visualized is a collection of stage performance statistics (from the years 1984 to 2018) scraped by Yaakov Bressler which can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/opening-the-stage-door-for-big-data-in-broadway-20ca3e35a274).
Broadway data in particular is not the most accessible, as many of its data housing sites don't offer APIs or mass download options. Quarantine has been a good excuse for me to revisit some old interests and hobbies, but after watching through all of the musicals I was already familiar with, I wanted to find a new show to invest in. I thought it might be a good start to find shows with either a high average ticket cost, capacity, or both. While I could have just searched for such numbers in a spreadsheet, I'm more of a visual learner, and what better way to learn than for course credit?


What I saw in the data was not terribly surprising (especially regarding the performances with the highest average ticket cost like Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen), but it did remind me of titles that I am not familiar with, but have heard of in the past. The increasing cost of average ticket prices over the years is was also to be expected.

To be honest, I feel like more could have been added to the app to make it more interactive, but I got so incredibly stuck on the range of appropriate mouseX and mouseY values that I figured once I did manage to get it working that it's good enough for government work. I hope you enjoy it regardless!

Shoutout to Professor Compton as well, as much of this code was very much based off of what she provided us. Couldn't have done this one (or any of these tbh) without her!

A special shoutout to Samuel Benjamin for his compareDates function!

As always, shoutout to google fonts for free stuff!
