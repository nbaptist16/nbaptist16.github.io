**Acknowledgements**

Based on the incredible twitter account, Thoughts of Dog¬Æ (@dog_feelings), which never ceases to brighten my day.

The adorable paw print background is originally from [Itchy & Scratchy Dog Home Boarding & Walking](https://www.496fba71-f1dc-45df-90b0-06b3ad977239.com/prices). I thought it was a nice color scheme and that it looks just like the animal crossing wall paper (and I was too swamped to draw D:).

Huuuuge shoutout to Professor Compton for providing us with such nice code!
Tracery is the bomb.
